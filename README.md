# Lab8 - Pig Latin (modified)

Create a program that takes a string in from the user and then transforms it into (Modified) Pig Latin using the modified rule:
-	The first letter is put at the end and “ay” is added to the word.
Ex.  “pig” in Pig Latin is “igpay”.
*Note – the “rules” of Pig Latin are not this simple, but we do not have the programming skills yet to follow the more particular rules of Pig Latin, so we will call this our Modified Pig Latin.

Requirements –
-	Instruct the user to enter a word.  The output is the word in (modified) Pig Latin.
-	Don't forget your header comments.

Note:  you do not need to check for spaces – assume the user is only entering one word.
